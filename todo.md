- [x] make sure train code leverages GPU 11/21
- [x] verify output of model is correct  11/22
- [ ] split training into multiple phases
  - [x] cell that trains and save model params 11/25 //
  - <del> cell that loads model checkpoint and outputs a video </del>
  - <del> cell that loads model checkpoint and outputs still images </del>
  - [ ] cell that loads model checkpoint and outputs still images + video  
    - [x] MVP 11/25
    - [x] Verify output is reasonable 11/26
    - [ ] remove unecessary code

- [ ] design choice - gigantic args object may be confusing for inexperienced users
  - [ ] decide what args should be kept constant, and which should be changed by the user
    - [ ] ie rather than a million boolean vars get rid of them and just turn if statements into  functions
    - [ ] add new args
      - [ ] ex num of output images
